What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository am creating a hiden file called .git 
and I need it to save all my commits in it

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is where I chose to operate on files from the repository
and it offers me clear sight to commit for one ligical change
