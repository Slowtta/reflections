When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Since am away from my local and I need to keep working on my project I can use another computer 
or ther's another person working on my project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 

am not the only one who make changes in my remote repository, having Git automatically stay up-to date without my permission "manually"
can affect all my project without me knowing about it

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

I can forck repos directly from Github to my own account 
Then I can clone them from my account in Github to my computer
and I use branches When I need To add a new feature or test 
I new path without affecting the progression of the project
